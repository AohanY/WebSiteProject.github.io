                    Regret is a negative cognitive or emotional state that involves blaming ourselves for a bad outcome, feeling a sense of loss 
                    or sorrow at what might have been, or wishing we could undo a previous choice that we made. <br><br>

                    For young people in particular, regret, although painful to experience, can be a helpful emotion. The pain of regret can 
                    result in refocusing and taking corrective action or pursuing a new path. However, the less opportunity one has to change the 
                    situation, the more likely it is that regret can turn into rumination and trigger chronic stress that damages mind and body.
