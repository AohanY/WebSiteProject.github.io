                    Regret is a universal emotional response experienced when “the outcome of a decision is worse than the outcome of an 
                    option foregone.”1 Fortunately, there are many techniques you can learn and use as ways to cope with, understand, and 
                    manage feelings of regret when they arise. Mental health professionals with a specialty in cognitive behavioral therapy 
                    (CBT) can help with this process.<br><br>

                    Here are ten useful tips on how to deal with regret:

                    <ol>
                        <li class="content">Acknowledge Your Feelings</li>
                        <p class="list_text">
                            Acknowledge and accept the feelings associated with your regret. This helps prompt you to think about strategies 
                            you could use to minimize the pain of similar future experiences.<br><br>

                            Specifically identifying or acknowledging which emotion you're feeling (“I feel regret”) rather than just 
                            thinking (“I feel bad”) will help make you tolerate the emotions you're experiencing.

                        <p class="list_text">
                            Try to learn from a past decision that you perceive has gone wrong. If you continue to chastise yourself with 
                            past regrets, it will compromise your ability to make better decisions in the present and the future. Obsessing 
                            about regrets will only make you feel worse. Use this as an opportunity to learn and even inspire yourself to 
                            make new and better choices in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p class="list_text">
                            Take time to evaluate the choice that ended in regret. Did you blame others, minimize your feelings, or ignore 
                            them altogether? These techniques tend to amplify feelings of regret and make them harder to cope with. Take a 
                            deep breath and remember, that choice you made is in the past.
                        </p>
                        <li class="content">Show Yourself Some Kindness</li>
                        <p class="list_text">
                            Having made a bad choice in the past does not mean you are forever doomed to repeat this mistake over and over 
                            again. Give yourself permission to tackle a similar situation again with the benefit of experience and hopefully 
                            a better understanding about how to react in a more positive fashion.

                        <p class="list_text">
                            If your regret is related to a major past decision, you need to give yourself time to heal from the consequences 
                            of that choice. Constantly thinking about it and ruminating will keep the negative thoughts and feelings 
                            ever-present. Focus on things that will relax, nourish, and energize you in positive ways. In time, the negative 
                            emotions will begin to subside.

                            Focus your mind and energy on a project with an outcome that will make you feel good. Spend time with people you 
                            feel comfortable with and who you can candidly talk with. If you are focused on a current positive distraction, 
                            you are less apt to ruminate about past regrets.

                            Use the knowledge and experience you gained to make new, realistic goals. Ask yourself if there is anything you 
                            can do to repair the old damage, respond to future situations, and create more positive outcomes. Celebrate when 
                            you meet a goal. If you learn that a goal you set is not realistic, set a new one within the realm of more 
                            realistic possibilities.

                        <p class="list_text">
                            Psychologist Suma Chand, PhD recommends asking yourself a series of questions as a way to move forward from 
                            regret and create healthier behavioral patterns. The questions are:

                            <ul>
                                <li class="paragraph">Have you noticed how excessive regret affects what you do and say?</li>
                                <li class="paragraph">Could you have acted any differently considering the particular stage in your life and the information and experiences you had until this point in your life?</li>
                                <li class="paragraph">Was it only you or did anything else contribute to your mistake?</li>
                                <li class="paragraph">Was there anything specific in the situation that you particularly regret?</li>
                                <li class="paragraph">As a result of this regretful experience, have you changed the way you behave and respond in similar situations?</li>
                                <li class="paragraph">Is there anything you can do now that will make a difference in how you think and feel about a future situation that you may regret?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <li class="content">Recognize the Physical & Emotional Toll Regret Can Cause</li>
                        <p class="list_text">
                            Repeated regretful feelings can negatively affect your mental health, causing depression, diminished focus, low 
                            self-esteem, and feelings of helplessness. They can also cause lack of sleep, loss of appetite, and headaches. 
                            Research on continual regret and the associated medical consequences in older adults reveals that it can cause 
                            vulnerability to physical symptoms like chest or joint pain, headaches, or shortness of breath, as well as the 
                            potential for worsening chronic illnesses like heart disease.
