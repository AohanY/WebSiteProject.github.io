                    Regret, like all difficult emotions is neither intrinsically good nor bad. It's a feeling like many other feelings, but 
                    it is the actions that we choose following the emotion that make a difference to our long-term well-being.<br><br>

                    It's important for us to feel the emotion (like when we feel bad about something), so we can process the emotion. 
                    Oppression of negative emotions does no one any good. The more you ruminate — especially about what you can't control — 
                    the harder it will be to work through painful feelings. So, what makes regret bad is when we don't use the lessons it 
                    gives us or when we choose to keep suffering from it. You can't rewind time. You can't go back and fix it, so beating 
                    yourself up is not good.<br>

                    For example, maybe you regret that you didn't get a salary increase last year. Instead of thinking about what could've 
                    happened if you did get it, think about the fact that you still have a job or that you worked on some amazing projects, 
                    and that this year presents you with the opportunity to get a raise. What can you control here? How much effort you put 
                    in and how hard you work. That's when regret is a good thing. If you keep contemplating, it's going to eat into your 
                    present and prevent you from putting your soul into your work and strive for a better year. That's when regret is bad.
