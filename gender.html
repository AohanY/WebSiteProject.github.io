                Studies on gender differences in regret show the increased value that women put on relationships and how women may have more 
                difficulty disengaging attention from past relationships. Overall, 44 percent of women surveyed in one study had romantic 
                regrets, versus just 19 percent of men.<br><br>

                This result may also reflect men's greater tendency to replace lost relationships quickly with new partners. In this study, 
                those not currently in a relationship had, perhaps understandably, more regret over past ones.
